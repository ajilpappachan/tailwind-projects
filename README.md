A collection of website projects based on the udemy course "[Tailwind CSS From Scratch | Learn By Building Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/)" by Brad Traversy. The objective of these projects are to learn and practice Tailwind CSS. The projects were templated and built with Vite.
